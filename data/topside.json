Once a rare lifeline for settlers during the age of Sunrise, it became a shell-scarred battleground during the closing battles of the First Wave.\n\nEven now, these toxic, waterlogged lands remain a hot spot for ARC skirmishes. Between the research buildings, various Dam structures, and the ramshackle hydroponic domes, Raiders know it to be a reliable source of valuable loot."

During this time, ARC seemed as disoriented as most Raiders, with many of its most menacing machines temporarily retreating."
